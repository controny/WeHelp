# WeHelp

## Introduction
WeHelp is a mutually helping platform among friends, targeting contemporary college students. Our inspiration comes from those trivial annoying things in the daily life of the college students. Considering one of the most common features of these students is that they and their most friends usually share common living area, similar living habits and similar trivial troubles. As a result, there is a greate demand in helping each other among college students and the efficiency would be high enough. WeHelp is aimed to create a social circle solving the daily troubles of college students by sharing. Different from those IM social software, where the connect of friends only goes so far as to chatting, our platform would create more reactions in reality. Also different from those mutually helping platform among strangers, where trust is lacking, our platform would encourage users to offer help more voluntarily.
